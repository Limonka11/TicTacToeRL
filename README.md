# TicTacToeRL

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python.
The repo also contains a Reinforcement Learning agent class that uses the Q-Learning algorithm.

For some reason, saving and loading the Q-table does not work. If the agent isn't
appropriately trained, please rerun the `tic_tac_toe.py` script.

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```
3. Install dependencies:
